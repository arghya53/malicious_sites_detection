In this project, I have used Random forest classifier, Lightgbm, and XGBoost to identify benign as well as different types of 
malicious websites like defacement, phishing, and malware websites.
Considering precision, f1-score, and recall, the accuracy of the Random forest classifier is the highest. Which is about 98.6%
Although each algorithm has its own dominant features, hostname length and length of directory are the common impactful features.
