# malicious_sites_detection
In this project I have implemented machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, extreme gradient boosting, and light gradient boosting machines to identify the best approach to detect any malicious website.
I have used the `https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sid321axn/malicious-urls-dataset/data` dataset from Kaggle for this project
